# Introduction

Computational Arts builds upon the foundational programming skills developed in Creative Coding. This module explores the diverse applications of programming in creative fields, with a focus on game development and creative media.

# Structure

Thursday:

- 11:00-13:00 - Studio Classroom
- 13:00-14:00 - Time for lunch and engagement with campus activities
- 14:00-16:00 - Studio Classroom

*Studio Classroom* means: we work together in a lab class on various topics and projects, building competency through experience, in various areas of software and games development. We will take plenty of breaks to get up and walk around.

At the end of the module, each student will have the ability to develop a complete digital game from scratch incorporating logic, movement and gameplay and manage their work on github.

# Assessment

Task!

Only 14 people sumbitted the work last week so please work on your liminal low poly environment

Register for the [Irish Godot Users Group meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/create-holograms-with-godot-tickets-1982738409958?aff=oddtdtcreator)!!
Create the environment using CSG nodes
Create 5 different things for the player to collect in the environment
Create a user interface that shows how many items the player has collected
Add lights and fog and experiment with the settings in the WorldEnvironment node to get a nice look
Upload screenshots to Brightspace
Add an NPC!
Add sounds!

Bonus!

Use a Dictionary and create an inventory system where the player can collect items


## Week 2
- Resources
- Godot 3D Nodes

Task

- Create a Low Poly liminal 3D Environment with an outdoor area and an indoor area
- For the outdoor area, create some terrain and some props in the form of low poly trees, a building and maybe a low poly vehicle or animal. 
- For the indoor area, create a table, a chair, a lamp an old skool TV
- Use CSGNodes and apply materials. Juset use the albedo color
- Add fog and lights
- Make the TV turn on
- Procedurally create some physics objects
- Create a sound generating item such as a 
- Create some collectable items in the environment
- Take screenshots and upload to Brightspace
